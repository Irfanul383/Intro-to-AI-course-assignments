# Projects for my Intro-to-AI course where I learned and implemented several AI algorithms. Since was a school project I am not allowed to share any code of assignments, however, the professor has allowed me to share short video samples.


# Project 1: Pathfinding Search Algorithms

## Overview
Involves implementing pathfinding search algorithms in a grid-based environment. The `Search_Student` class is developed to conduct searches using Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS), determined by the provided configuration.

# Project 2: Advanced Pathfinding Algorithms

## Overview
In this project, part of COMP3200 (Artificial Intelligence), advanced pathfinding algorithms are implemented in a grid-based environment. The `Search_Student` class performs searches using A* algorithm, accommodating different agent sizes and heuristic functions.

# Project 3: Iterative Deepening Alpha-Beta Pruning

## Overview
This project, part of COMP3200 (Artificial Intelligence), features the implementation of Iterative Deepening Alpha-Beta (IDAB) pruning in a Connect Four game. The `Player_Student` class is designed to find the best action for a player using IDAB within specified time and depth constraints.

# Project 4: Genetic Algorithm for Sudoku Solver

## Overview
In this assignment for COMP3200, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) is developed to solve Sudoku puzzles. The project involves implementing a GA in the `GA_Student.js` file, where the GA evolves a population of potential solutions (Sudoku grids) towards an optimal or near-optimal solution.

# Project 5: Reinforcement Learning in Grid Environment

## Overview
This project, part of COMP3200 (Artificial Intelligence), involves implementing a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm in a grid-based environment. The `RL_Student.js` file contains the code for the RL agent, which learns to navigate the environment using Q-learning, a popular RL algorithm.
